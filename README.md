# Project 2 – HemeBiotech

**HemeBiotech** is the 2nd project of the Java Developer path at [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/).

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to get familiar with the Java language and basic file I/O handling by debugging and improving an existing application.

## 💡 Application Purpose

The application is designed to:
- Read a text file containing a list of symptoms (one symptom per line).
- Count the number of occurrences of each symptom.
- Write the result to an output file in alphabetical order.

## ⚙️ Tasks Completed

- ✅ Debugged the file reading functionality to make the input process functional.
- ✅ Developed a file writing mechanism to output each symptom and its occurrence count.
- ✅ Ensured proper sorting and formatting of the results in the output file.

## 📁 File Structure

- `symptoms.txt` – Input file containing the list of symptoms.
- `result.out` – Output file generated by the application.
- `com.hemebiotech.analytics` – Main Java package containing:
  - `ReadSymptomDataFromFile.java`
  - `WriteSymptomDataToFile.java`
  - `AnalyticsCounter.java`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Java 11+
- Maven (optional for dependency management)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hemebiotech.git
   cd hemebiotech
   ```

2. Make sure `symptoms.txt` is located in the root directory.

3. Compile and run the application:
   ```bash
   javac com/hemebiotech/analytics/*.java
   java com.hemebiotech.analytics.AnalyticsCounter
   ```

4. Check the output in `result.out`.
